I work for Alabama Power located in ... you guessed it, Alabama! <br><br>
I work as a SCADA technician. SCADA is Supervisory Control and Data Aquisition.

<h3>ðŸ”­ I Am Currently Working On</h3>
I recently had the opportunity to take on a project developing an app to support tracking test equipment in my department.<br>
It uses a form based platform to query a database, so I don't have to worry about the front end. But I do need to better understand how to use SQL and some HTML to customize the form pages.<br><br>
I am excited by this project and the chance to deepen my knowledge of programming. So I enrolled in the Backend Developer programming bootcamp with Promineo Tech!

<h3>ðŸ”­ Something Else About Me</h3>
I also have a side business called Delta T Solutions, LLC.<br><br>
My goal with this business is to be able to offer affordable, customizable home security and automation solutions.<br><br>
The more I have learned about this industry, the more I see the need to be adept at programming in order to offer the most customizable solutions possible.<br><br> This is another reason I enrolled with Promineo Tech.

<h3>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Currently Learning</h3>
